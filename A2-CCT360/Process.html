        <h3 class="display-4">Rationale</h3>
        <p>The guide framework of the website I designed is "portfolio", which
          can be explained as uploading and structuring my experience and interest
          in a professional form. Therefore, my rationale is creating a simple, clear
          and professional webpage to show my interests and characteristics. It will
          let others know more information, including my working experience and skills
          about me. This will also be useful for me to apply a job in the future, if I want
          to get a web design job.</p>

          <h3 class="display-4">Steps for Ideation and Creation</h3>
          <p>(First, the design framework is based on my previous lab and bootstrap.) </p>
          <ul>Plan
            <li>Decide the main title I need to put on my three inner pages</li>
            <li>For the Homepage, decide which picture I need to use as my jumbetron background</li>
            <li>Decide the design style/form (Cards, jumbetron, slideshow, progress bar and carousel)
               I want to use for my website base on Bootstrap framework</li>
            <li>Adjust the margin and padding mainly through the code of bootstrap.css.min6</li>
            <li>Check its accessability and whether it can fit on different screen size.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For the perspective of mood boards, most of them are referenced from
            my previous lab. For example, my Gallery page, since gallery is the page,
            which should contain amount of pictures, I decide to tile all my photos and
            productions neatly on the web page. The reader will see the photo descriptions
            after they click on the image. For the other pages, the image arragement should
            near my name, since they are used to introduce myself. Each of my paragraph is
            followed a subtitle/title, which is to explain or provide more information around
            the title. </p>

            <p>For the perspective of colour palettes, I choose blue as my main color.
              Therefore, all of colors I put on my webpage is around the color blue.
              It can make sure that I have a clear and neat page. I use three different
              blue color on my technical skills on Resume page is because they have
              different length. I have different mastery of these skills.</p>

            <p>For the perspective of typographic, I decide to put my important content,
              including my name and each webpage's title, as heading. It will catch
              audiences' eyes in a short time.  Display heading helps decide my title's
              font size. It can let my heading stand out. Descripton list alignment is
              quite useful, when I was designing "Resume.html", especially on the part
              of technical skills. List unstyled help remove the default list-style, which
              means I can put less content on my stylesheet.</p>
